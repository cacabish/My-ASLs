# My-ASLs
A collection of all of my Auto Splitters scripts written for LiveSplit.

# Usage
Open LiveSplit's splits editor and enter in the game's name. The Auto Splitter (if I've linked it correctly) should appear above the splits. Simply click the Activate button.

You may also download the script. To add to your layout, go to Control -> Scriptable Auto Splitter, add it to your layout, open the layout settings, and point it to the file you downloaded. This is generally only used to test new scripts and normally shouldn't be used. Make sure that you right-click on LiveSplit -> Compare Against -> Game Time or else you will be viewing the real time!
